## To run the repo locally

To start a local server on port 1080 run:

`gulp dev-server`

Hot loading is enabled, meaning that any changes made in the code will appear on the page by just saving the file. No re-building necessary.

## To create a build version

`gulp build`

This will place the proper assets in the `/dist` and `/www` folders.
