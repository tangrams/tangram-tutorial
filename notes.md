### Boundaries and Barriers

This layer includes all of those things you would expect to be boundaries as well as a few other goodies: OpenStreetMap administrative boundaries (national borders, provinces, regions, municipalities, cities), Natural Earth boundaries (such as maritime boundaries), and even a few details at high zoom levels like the fence lines around some petting zoos. They keywords you should remember for this layer are:

* Layer name: `boundaries`
* Geometry types: `lines`

-What is included in the vector tiles? How to explain difference with Mapbox?
* Renamed many things from OSM. Based off of.
* POI: minutely feed - tile build queue. Hours/Days. Check Rob with most current up to date.

## To do:

-Add zoom level and coordinates to all examples
-Why does the geometry masking section not work? https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/Raster-Overview/
-Explain what happens when you add label points to 'places'
-For places layer clarify if `points` means you can add `text`
