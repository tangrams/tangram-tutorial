TODO:

* how do i know they are polygons?
* filter other things that are not 'properties' - like id in this example
* include something about inheritance
* order doesn't seem to matter within a group. why do we use order:

## Concluding Thoughts

* clarify that available for ES and JS flavors - same grammar
* link to other examples/demos
* link to how to host a map or Mapzen JS? --> critical next steps
* a note about API keys
