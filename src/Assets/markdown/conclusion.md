## Concluding thoughts

We hope you've enjoyed learning some Tangram basics and feel empowered to read through our [docs](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/) for more advanced capabilities.

### Deploying your map on the web and on mobile

Tangram is available in two delicious flavors: [Tangram JS](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram) is a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugin for browser-based mapping, and [Tangram ES](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram-es) is a C++ library for native mobile and embedded devices.

The syntax and parameters for the two libraries are (mostly) the same so everything you've learned in this tutorial apply to both platforms.

We've built two tutorials specifically geared towards helping you deploy a map on each platform:
