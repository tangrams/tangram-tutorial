## How do we style a map?

Tangram maps are styled using a custom styling syntax inside of a <strong>scene file</strong>. The scene file is a YAML document which organizes all of the elements Tangram uses to draw a map. This file describes a hierarchy of objects which control every aspect of your map, including data sources, feature layers, lights, cameras, textures, and more.

Why YAML? Well, YAML is a data format similar in many ways to JSON, but it has some unique features which we thought made it more friendly and easy to use for our purposes.

In this tutorial, you will become familiar with the syntax, rules, and capabilities of the Tangram rendering engine, meaning you'll be able to write valid YAML documents that contain the rules required to style 2D and 3D maps.
