### Boundaries and Barriers

This layer includes all of those things you would expect to be boundaries as well as a few other goodies: OpenStreetMap administrative boundaries (national borders, provinces, regions, municipalities, cities), Natural Earth boundaries (such as maritime boundaries), and even a few details at high zoom levels like the fence lines around some petting zoos. They keywords you should remember for this layer are:

* Layer name: `boundaries`
* Geometry types: `lines`
