## Vector vs. Raster Tiles

Congratulations! If you've made it this far you've learned how to build basic maps, a few styling rules, and the many uses of data filters. Now we're about to head into the heart of Tangram and learn how we can get free data about any place on earth.

Let's go back to the map we've been building in previous sections. We've managed to draw our countries, but what if we wanted to color the oceans? With our current GeoJSON file we can't really do that, because the only data it provides is countries (represented as polygons). This is where vector tiles come in.
