## What is the minimum map I can build?

Let's get right to it and style the most basic map we can build with Tangram.

To create a map, the scene file requires only:

* a data source (vector tiles)
* data interpretation rules (filters)
* styling rules (how the data should look on the map)

<div class='alert-message'>
We'll be using a special app that embeds Tangram code on the right and a Leaflet/Tangram map on the left to instantly view the results of our scene file. Take a look below!
</div>
