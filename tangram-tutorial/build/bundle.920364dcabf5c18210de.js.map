Since each country is a multipolygon, we&#39;re styling the &#39;countries&#39; layer with a <code>polygon</code> style.

The scene file is a YAML document which organizes all of the elements Tangram uses to draw a map. This file describes a hierarchy of objects which control every aspect of your map, including data sources, feature layers, lights, cameras, textures, and more.</p> <p>Why YAML? Well, YAML is a data format similar in many ways to JSON, but it has some unique features which we thought made it more friendly and easy to use for our purposes.</p> <p>Im this tutorial, you will become familiar with the syntax, rules, and capabilities of the Tangram rendering engine, meaning you&#39;ll be able to write valid YAML documents that contain the rules required to style 2D and 3D maps.</p> <div class=alert-message> Yellow call-outs like this are meant to draw your attention to an important idea or distinction you should keep in mind. </div>\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./app/Markdown/intro.md\n ** module id = 300\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","var React = require('react');\n\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Row';\nimport TangramPlay from '../TangramPlay.react';\n\nimport min from '../../Markdown/min.md';\nimport min2 from '../../Markdown/min2.md';\nimport min3 from '../../Markdown/min3.md';\nimport min4 from '../../Markdown/min4.md';\nimport min5 from '../../Markdown/min5.md';\nimport min6 from '../../Markdown/min5.md';\n\nimport examples from './links';\n\nexport class Tutorial21 extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n        <Row className=\"show-grid\">\n            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: min }} />\n            <TangramPlay url={examples.min} />\n            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: min2 }} />\n        </Row>\n        )}\n}\n\nexport class Tutorial22 extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n        <Row className=\"show-grid\">\n            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: min3 }} />\n            <TangramPlay url={examples.layers} />\n            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: min4 }} />\n            <TangramPlay url={examples.layers2} />\n            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: min5 }} />\n            <TangramPlay url={examples.layers3} />\n            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: min6 }} />\n        </Row>\n        )}\n}\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./app/Components/Tutorial/Tutorial2Min.react.js\n **/","import React from 'react';\n\n/**\n * Represents an icon that receives a 'type' prop indicating how it should look\n * as well as an optional 'active' prop indicating whether icon should be active\n */\nexport default class TangramPlay extends React.Component {\n    /**\n     * Official React lifecycle method\n     * Called every time state or props are changed\n     */\n    render () {\n        return (\n            <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"700px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen src={this.props.url}>\n            </iframe>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n/**\n * Prop validation required by React\n */\nTangramPlay.propTypes = {\n    url: React.PropTypes.string,\n};\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./app/Components/TangramPlay.react.js\n **/","module.exports = \"<h2 id=what-is-the-minimum-map-i-can-build->What is the minimum map I can build?</h2> <p>Let&#39;s get right to it and style the most basic map we can build with Tangram.</p> <p>To create a map, the scene file requires only:</p> <ul> <li>a data source (vector tiles)</li> <li>data interpretation rules (filters)</li> <li>styling rules (how the data should look on the map)</li> </ul> <div class=alert-message> We&#39;ll be using a special app that embeds Tangram code on the right and a Leaflet/Tangram map on the left to instantly view the results of our scene file.
